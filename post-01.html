							<p>Bees are vital to a healthy environment and healthy economy. They're also simply beautiful and fascinating little insects. We need bees. We may take them and other pollinators like butterflies and hoverflies for granted, but they're vital to stable, healthy food supplies and key to the varied, colourful and nutritious diets we need. Bees are perfectly adapted to pollinate, helping plants grow, breed and produce food. They do so by transferring pollen between flowering plants and therefore keeping the cycle of life turning</p>

							<p>There's growing public and political concern at bee decline across the world. This decline is caused by a combination of stresses â€“ from loss of habitat and food sources to exposure to pesticides and the effects of climate breakdown.More than ever before, we need to recognise the importance of bees to nature and to our lives. And we need to turn that into action to ensure they don't just survive but thrive.</p>
							
							<blockquote>Not all bees are the same. There are over 20,000 known species of bee globally. Around 270 species of bee have been recorded in the UK. Only 1 of these is the famous Honeybee. Most Honeybees are kept by beekeepers in colonies of managed hives. The rest of our bees are wild, including 25 bumblebee species and more than 220 types of solitary bee.</blockquote>
							

							<p>Like Honeybees, the familiar Bumblebees live in social colonies - usually in holes in the ground or tree cavities.Solitary bees tend to nest on their own, as the name suggests. Each female builds and provisions her own nest with food. Solitary bees include Mining bees which nest in the ground, as well as Mason bees and Leafcutter bees that nest in holes in dead wood, banks and walls.</p>
